# CULT Chatrooms Microservice
In the context of the wallstreetbets thriller we saw how quickly the centralized powerstructures took our subreddit and our discord server down.   

In order to ensure free speech and communication, we establish cultchatrooms. For this usecase it seems crucial to have a decentralized backend - be it polygon (each message would be paid gas fees for which might be even a good thing to improve the efficiency of communication - because people will carefully think about what they send before they send it) or be it ipfs (bulk savings?)
In order to strengthen resilience, scalability and technological freedom for contributors, we establish a microservices architecture.

First Drafts & Idea Collection

## Frontend
When it comes to state of the art web programming frameworks [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is the framework [of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4) imo.    
The two main reasons for that choice - comparing svelte to angular, vue and react - are performance and simplicity.   
You might continuously improve the performance of this page utilizing [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).   
To speed up programming while ensuring beauty we utilize the [UI Kit Attractions](https://illright.github.io/attractions/?ref=madewithsvelte.com) - see also [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkD88ARvucM&t=492s).

If you use VS Code as IDE you might want to install the extension named "svelte for vs code".  

## Backend
to be decided --> any low cost (layer 2...) chain like Polygon, Arbitrum, ... might be appropriate in this context.
